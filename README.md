## WPI Virtual Postcard Designer

I've been thinking a lot about graduation lately and postcards came to mind, so I thought I'd make a WPI postcard creator.
It just asks for your name, a title, a message and to choose some colors.
You can save the one you're making and then make anohter one, plus delete it.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: this is a single page app where the server concatenates the user name (in server.improved.js, and then passes it to main.js, where it creates the rest of the postcard for the user).
That concatenation is added to the postcard.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: postcards can be deleted.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: notes from meeting with other students using the think-aloud protocol:

1) Last name: Jacobs
2) Problems?: not really a problem, but slow image preview loading time.
3) Comments: itâ€™s cool that you can switch between images in the preview; cool site overall.
4) What I'd change: maybe load all images first and then have the user select them.

1) Last name: Perez
2) Problems?: Everything works properly for me.
3) Comments: I like the color scheme, preview color of the text area box, and the postcard maker overall is a very cool idea. If there was a way to make the image preview larger that may help with accessibility.
4) What I'd change: I would change the image preview to have them all be displayed and you can zoom in on one at a time, like a carousels.
